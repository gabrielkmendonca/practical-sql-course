SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard.

To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:
    ->  An (RDBMS) database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL);
    ->  To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP;
    ->  To use SQL to get the data you want;
    ->  To use HTML / CSS to style the page.

/*
Relational Database Management System is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
The Database structure:
    ->  The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
    ->  Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.
    ->  A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.
    ->  A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
